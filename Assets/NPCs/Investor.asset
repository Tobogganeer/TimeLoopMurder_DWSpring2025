  - whenAsked: 0
    respondWith: It's a pleasure seeing you here. Your father told me all about you.
  - whenAsked: 3
    respondWith: We were former business partners. The best of the best, actually.
      We were very successful together, making HUGE amounts of money. I'm telling
      ya, it's weird how difficult he's being with me these days. He isn't co-operating
      like he used to.
  - whenAsked: 2
    respondWith: Oh, I just got out of a meeting with your father. He doesn't want
      me to buy his company, but he'll want to eventually. I just gotta make an offer
      he can't refuse.
  - whenAsked: 1
    respondWith: I'm trying to settle a deal with your father. It'll be the best
      of the best deals in history. If I purchase his company, it'll make millions-
      no, billions more than it does now.
  - whenAsked: 4
    respondWith: I hope I get to talk to you again later. I still haven't told you
      about all of my successes. They're HUGE successes.
  - whenAsked: 5
    respondWith: Next to the booze, tryna chat your dad into breaking a deal with
      me, obviously! I'm not some lily-livered coward who gives up chasing the BIGGEST
      opportunity of his life! The money made offa this deal will be huge, I'm tellin'
      ya.
  evidenceResponses:
  - whenShown: 2
    respondWith: Oh yes, it's that fireplace in that room. It's obviously not as
      good as my fireplace, but it's not like your father even knows about it. He's
      never been to my place before.
  - whenShown: 0
    respondWith: Flat dress shoes, the dress shoes to end all other dress shoes.
      They're made out of the richest material known to mankind.
  - whenShown: 3
    respondWith: The cabinet? No, can't say for sure. I've seen the room during my
      stay here, but didn't take the time to inspect everything.
  - whenShown: 1
    respondWith: Oh definitely, I'm very strong. As a matter of fact, I'm so strong
      that I could cause an earthquake right here, right now.
  - whenShown: 4
    respondWith: No, I didn't. I prefer to keep things neat, being a perfectionist
      myself. If I was in there and saw that rug looking like it, I would fix it
      right away.
  - whenShown: 6
    respondWith: What safe? Is your father hiding any secrets from me that he doesn't
      want me to know? If so, he's probably afraid of me. Everyone who's against
      me is.
  - whenShown: 7
    respondWith: I've never been informed of his will.
  - whenShown: 8
    respondWith: No, your father hasn't told me anything like that. Hopefully he's
      changing it so that I can get his company, though.
