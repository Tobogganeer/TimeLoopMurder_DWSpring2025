    respondWith: Oh, hello sweetie! What do you need?
  - whenAsked: 3
    respondWith: That's a silly question. Your father and I raised you ever since
      you were just a little baby. A lot has changed since then, but I still remember
      the first time I saw you like it was just yesterday. Those were the days where
      life was a lot simpler.
  - whenAsked: 2
    respondWith: What? Am I not allowed to have a smell from the barrel? Tonight's
      an occasion that calls for it, and you know that I'm not one for missed opportunities.
  - whenAsked: 1
    respondWith: Why wouldn't I be? Your father and I are expecting guests for dinner,
      so it's only natural that I would want to be there to welcome them and be a
      good hostess.

    respondWith: Take care, sweetie! Love you!

    respondWith: Well, I know how much you love being close to it for warmth every
      winter. Does that answer your question?
  - whenShown: 0
    respondWith: Nothing special, they're just flat dress shoes. Do you like them?
  - whenShown: 3
    respondWith: Of course I do, sweetie. It's where your father keeps his gun.
  - whenShown: 1
    respondWith: Of course I'm strong enough to move the potted plant. I moved it
      there last week, remember?
  - whenShown: 4
    respondWith: Oh, I don't know about that. I might've tripped on it without paying
      attention to what I was doing, but I honestly couldn't tell you.
